            An all-metal, single-seat fighter-bomber with one turbojet engine.
            The aircraft was created by a group of Lockheed engineers (headed by <b>Clarence "Kelly" Johnson</b>) in only 143 days.
            The first flight of the <b>XP-80</b> prototype was performed in January 1944. 
            The first production version, designated the <b>P-80A Shooting Star</b>, entered service in 1946. The P-80 became 
            the first combat-capable jet aircraft to enter service with the USAAF.
            1947 saw the appearance of the next production version of the aircraft,
            the P-80B. The ninth production P-80A-1 was converted to a new prototype,
            designated the XP-80B. It had an <b>Allison J33-A-17</b> turbojet engine producing
            1,816 kg of thrust, equipped with a methanol-water injection system.

            The airfoil was thinner, but the skin's thickness was increased. 
            To install a water mixture tank, the plane's fuel quantity had to be
            sacrificed by reducing it from 1,781 to 1,610 liters The aircraft also
            received a Lockheed-designed ejection seat and a cockpit air-conditioning system.
            The plane's armament consisted of six <b>12.7 mm Colt-Browning M3 machine
            guns</b> with 300 rounds each in the forward fuselage. One <b>1,000 lb (454 kg)
            bomb</b> or ten <b>5-inch (127 mm) unguided HVAR</b> missiles could be suspended under each wing panel.
            A total of 240 P-80B fighter-bombers were built from March 1947 to March 1948, including 
            P-80B-1s and 31 P-80B-5s. The Ð’-5 variant was intended to be operated in Arctic conditions;
            its heated canopy prevented icing. In addition, special types of oil and special rubber
            were used to operate the aircraft in low temperature conditions.
            At least five <b>P-80Bs</b> were equipped with a guidance system for <b>Bell
            GAM-63 RASCAL air-to-surface missiles</b>.

            Externally, these aircraft differed in the shape of the forward fuselage and the wing-mounted
            tanks. Also, they were fitted with extra spoilers on the upper and lower wing surfaces.
            In June 1948, when the US military aircraft designation system was
            changed, the P-80B was renamed to the F-80B. When the Korean War 
            started, F-80Bs were stationed in the USA and in Europe, being used
            by the USAAF mainly for training purposes. Later, 117 F-80Bs were 
            brought up to the F-80C's standards and re-designated "F-80C-12." 
            The remaining F-80Bs were withdrawn from service by the end of 1951.
